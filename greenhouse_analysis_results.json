      "description": "About the Company\nThe mining industry has steadily become worse at finding new ore deposits, requiring >10X more capital to make discoveries compared to 30 years ago. The easy-to-find, near-surface deposits have largely been found, and the industry has chronically under-invested in new exploration technology, relying on the manual techniques of yesteryear \u2013 even as demand accelerates for copper, lithium, and other metals to build electric vehicles, renewable energy, and data centers.\nKoBold builds AI models for mineral exploration and deploys those models\u2014alongside our novel sensors\u2014to guide decisions on KoBold-owned-and-operated exploration programs. In the six years since founding, KoBold has become by far both the largest independent mineral exploration company and the largest exploration technology developer. Our data scientists and software engineers, who come from leading technology companies, jointly lead exploration programs with our renowned exploration geologists.\nKoBold has proven its first discovery with materially less capital than the industry average and found one of the best copper deposits ever discovered: the copper is far more concentrated than the global average of copper mines, and this asset alone is expected to generate meaningful revenue for decades. KoBold has a portfolio of more than 60 other projects, each of which has the potential for another high-quality discovery.\nKoBold is privately held; investors include institutional asset managers T. Rowe Price and Canada Pension Plan Investments; technology venture capitalists Andreessen Horowitz, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, BOND Capital, and Standard Investments; and natural resources companies Equinor, BHP, and Mitsubishi.\nAbout the Position\nThis Land/Mineral Rights Specialist position will provide essential operational support within KoBold's mineral rights and land management function, supporting the company's expanding global portfolio across multiple jurisdictions. The position will report to the Director of Mineral Rights and collaborate closely with the Mineral Rights Lead and other internal teams, including Business Development, Legal, Operations, and Community Engagement. The Land/Mineral Rights Specialist will contribute to the comprehensive administration of land assets, conduct jurisdictional research, facilitate permitting activities, and perform due diligence processes, while developing expertise in mineral tenure systems and regulatory frameworks.\nReporting to the Director of Mineral Rights\nResponsibilities\nExamine public records, deeds, and legal documents to determine mineral and surface rights ownership across multiple jurisdictions\nBuild and maintain property histories and databases to enhance institutional knowledge of the asset portfolio\nConduct jurisdictional assessments for mineral tenure requirements in regions where KoBold operates or is considering entry\nSupport due diligence activities for acquisitions, providing title information and risk analysis for Business Development\nPrepare and submit mineral rights applications, renewals, and assessment reports to maintain the good standing of company assets\nResearch regulatory requirements and support permitting activities for initial exploration work\nMaintain filing systems and documentation to ensure compliance with commercial and statutory requirements\nCollaborate with cross-functional teams to facilitate land transactions and identify above-ground risks\nQualifications\nDemonstrated proficiency in land administration, data management, or mineral rights work within the context of mineral exploration, mining, or oil and gas, evidenced by a minimum of 2-4 years of recent experience in the field\nFamiliarity with GIS principles and software applications for spatial analysis and mapping of land holdings\nStrong written and oral communication skills for effective interaction with government agencies, property owners, and internal stakeholders\nIn addition to the above, you will have:\nExperience with natural resource management or regulatory compliance in mining or energy sectors\nExperience interpreting regulations and laws related to land ownership and mineral rights\nExcellent interpersonal skills and collaborative mindset for cross-functional team coordination\nStrong analytical skills and attention to detail for complex legal document analysis\nDemonstrated ability to quickly absorb complex information with high intellectual rigor\nExperience writing clearly using standard office software and database systems\nAbility to work independently while maintaining high accuracy standards\nWe are seeking a proactive and results-driven individual who is passionate about land administration and mineral rights management and possesses the necessary expertise to drive success in a dynamic and challenging environment within the mineral exploration and mining industry. This role offers significant opportunities for professional development and exposure to international mineral tenure systems.\nKoBold Metals is an equal opportunity workplace and an affirmative action employer.
