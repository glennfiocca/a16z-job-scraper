SECTION MAPPING GUIDE - Different ATS platforms use different section headers:

ABOUT COMPANY (about_company field):
- Greenhouse/Lever: "About [Company]", "About Us", "Who We Are", "Company Overview"
- Ashby: "üöÄ Join...", "About [Company]", company description paragraphs at the top
- General: Any introductory paragraphs describing the company's mission, products, culture, or history

ROLE DESCRIPTION (about_job field):
- This should be a PARAGRAPH describing what the role is about, the team, and the overall purpose
- Should NOT include bullet points - those go in responsibilities
- Examples: "This position is on the TRS Core Infrastructure team and will be focused on building the infrastructure to field TRS Products such as Altius, Ghost, Bolt and Anvil. Our charter is to provide the foundation for teams across Anduril to deploy cutting edge TRS autonomy and to tie it all together into an easy-to-use product."

RESPONSIBILITIES (responsibilities field):
- Greenhouse/Lever: "About the Role", "The Role", "What You'll Do", "Responsibilities", "Key Responsibilities", "Day-to-Day"
- Ashby: "üíª Role", "üíª The Role", "What You'll Do"
- General: Bullet points describing daily tasks, duties, and what the person will do in this position
- These should be formatted as bullet points with "‚Ä¢ " prefix

QUALIFICATIONS (qualifications field):
- Greenhouse/Lever: "About You", "Requirements", "Qualifications", "What We're Looking For", "You Have"
- Ashby: "üëã You", "What You Bring", "Requirements"
- General: Skills, experience, education requirements - what the candidate MUST HAVE

BENEFITS (benefits field):
- Greenhouse/Lever: "Benefits & Perks", "What We Offer", "Perks", "Benefits"
- Ashby: "üéÅ Benefits", "üíº Perks", "What We Offer"
- General: Healthcare, PTO, retirement, perks, work-from-home allowances, parental leave, etc.

SALARY (salary_range field):
- Look for: "Compensation", "Salary Range", "$XXK - $YYK", "Base Salary", dollar amounts with "K" or "000"
- Ashby: "üí∏ Compensation", "üí∞ Salary" or under the "Compensation" section
- Important: Extract the ACTUAL salary numbers/range, not just "competitive" or "based on experience"
- Include equity mentions: "equity", "stock options", "RSUs" if part of the compensation

EXTRACTION RULES:
1. Copy text VERBATIM - do not summarize, paraphrase, or reword
2. Each field should capture its COMPLETE section, including all bullet points and paragraphs
3. about_job = PARAGRAPH describing what the role is about, the team, and overall purpose (NO bullet points)
4. responsibilities = BULLET POINTS describing specific tasks, duties, and what the person will do day-to-day
5. qualifications = What the candidate MUST HAVE (skills, experience, requirements)
6. Salary can appear in BOTH salary_range AND benefits - this is ALLOWED and EXPECTED
7. If a section has multiple paragraphs, include ALL of them
8. Preserve ALL bullet points - do not skip or omit any
9. REMOVE ALL EMOJIS from extracted text - no emojis should appear in any field (strip out üöÄ üíª üëã üéÅ üí∏ üí∞ üíº üíõ and all other emojis)

CRITICAL SEPARATION RULE:
- If you find a section that contains BOTH descriptive paragraphs AND bullet points, SEPARATE them:
  * Put the descriptive paragraph(s) in about_job field
  * Put the bullet points in responsibilities field
- Do NOT mix paragraphs and bullet points in the same field

CRITICAL BULLET POINT PRESERVATION RULES:
1. ALWAYS preserve existing bullet points from the source text
2. If source text has bullet points (‚Ä¢, *, -, etc.), convert them to "‚Ä¢ " format
3. Each bullet point must be on a SEPARATE LINE with actual line breaks
4. Do NOT convert bullet points to paragraphs or run-on text

ABOUT_JOB FORMATTING:
- about_job should be a PARAGRAPH describing the role, team, and overall purpose
- If there are multiple descriptive paragraphs, join them with double newlines
- Do NOT include bullet points in about_job field - those go in responsibilities
- Example: "This position is on the Buyer Growth team and will be focused on driving top-of-funnel growth, first-time buyer success, acquisition, activation, and early retention. You'll partner with product, data, design, and marketing to build user experiences that drive growth."

RESPONSIBILITIES FORMATTING:
- responsibilities should be BULLET POINTS (not paragraphs)
- PRESERVE all bullet points from the source text
- Each responsibility should be a separate bullet point with "‚Ä¢ " prefix
- Each bullet point must be on its own line
- Example:
‚Ä¢ Lead and scale critical growth initiatives such as onboarding flows, referral systems, guest browsing, notification systems
‚Ä¢ Design and own end-to-end systems, from backend services to frontend experiences, that impact millions of users
‚Ä¢ Work across product, marketing, and data science to identify high-leverage growth opportunities and rapidly iterate on experiments
‚Ä¢ Instrument, monitor, and improve funnels to drive measurable lifts in new user conversion and retention
‚Ä¢ Mentor other engineers and contribute to raising the bar for engineering excellence across the team

QUALIFICATIONS FORMATTING:
- PRESERVE all bullet points from the source text
- Each requirement, skill, or qualification should be a separate bullet point on its own line
- Include both required and preferred qualifications as separate bullets
- Each bullet point must be on a separate line with "‚Ä¢ " prefix
- Example format:
‚Ä¢ 5+ years of full-time, generalist software engineering experience in high growth tech companies
‚Ä¢ Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or related field or equivalent work experience
‚Ä¢ A strong foundation in backend and frontend development
‚Ä¢ Excellent product instincts and ability to take ownership of ambiguous areas

BENEFITS FORMATTING:
- PRESERVE all bullet points from the source text
- Each benefit, perk, or offering should be a separate bullet point on its own line
- Each bullet point must be on a separate line with "‚Ä¢ " prefix
- Example format:
‚Ä¢ Flexible Time off Policy and Company-wide Holidays
‚Ä¢ Health Insurance options including Medical, Dental, Vision
‚Ä¢ Work From Home Support with home office setup allowance
‚Ä¢ Care benefits including monthly wellness allowance and annual childcare allowance
‚Ä¢ 401k offering for Traditional and Roth accounts in the US with employer match up to 4%
‚Ä¢ 16 weeks of paid parental leave plus one month gradual return to work

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return ONLY a valid JSON object with these exact fields (no markdown, no explanation):
{
    "title": "exact job title",
    "company": "exact company name", 
    "about_company": "verbatim company description",
    "location": "primary city, state/country",
    "alternate_locations": "other locations as comma-separated string or null",
    "employment_type": "Full-time/Part-time/Contract/Internship",
    "about_job": "paragraph description of the role, team, and overall purpose (NO bullet points)",
    "responsibilities": "bullet-pointed responsibilities and tasks with ‚Ä¢ prefix, each on separate line",
    "qualifications": "bullet-pointed requirements and qualifications with ‚Ä¢ prefix, each on separate line", 
    "benefits": "bullet-pointed complete benefits section with ‚Ä¢ prefix, each on separate line",
    "salary_range": "exact salary range with equity info if mentioned",
    "work_environment": "Remote/Hybrid/Onsite or null"
}"""

        user_prompt = f"""Extract job information from this posting.

Job URL: {job_url}

EXTRACTION STEPS:
1. IDENTIFY sections by their headers (look for emoji headers on Ashby, text headers on others)
2. MAP each section to the correct JSON field using the Section Mapping Guide
3. COPY the complete section text verbatim into that field
